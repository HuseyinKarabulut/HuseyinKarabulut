# hüseyinkarabulut / README.md

I'm a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a passion for embedded systems, robotics, and hardware design. On my GitHub, I showcase projects that reflect my hands-on experience and interest in real-world problem-solving through innovative engineering.

## 🚀 Some of My Projects:

- **CoreXY 3D Printer Design**: A CoreXY-based 3D printer developed with a focus on modularity, affordability, and local production. Designed to be open-source and easily maintainable.

- **RFID-Based Access Control System**: Built using STM32 and RC522 RFID module, this project reads RFID card UIDs and displays them on an OLED screen, showcasing embedded systems and communication protocols.

- **Multi-Function RC Controller**: A remote control system using Raspberry Pi Pico, dual joysticks, OLED screen, buttons, and NRF24L01 module, designed for RC vehicles with an intuitive interface and power-efficient operation.

- **Adjustable Voltage Soldering Tool**: An ATTiny85-based controller for a soldering iron using a lithium-ion battery, capable of adjusting output voltage in three stages using a single button.

- **Ongoing PCB Designs**: Creating custom PCBs for my projects using KiCad and Fritzing, including parts like MKS Robin Nano V3.1 for 3D printing applications.
